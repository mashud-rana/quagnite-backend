    <strong>What is Java?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is
    used to develop apps, process huge amounts of data, etc. Many frameworks
    such as Apache Spark, Eclipse IDE, Google Android API, etc support Java.
    Java comes in 4 editions -&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Java Standard Edition (SE) - It is the foundation of the Java
        programming language. It provides the basic functionality to run any
        Java program. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Java Enterprise Edition (EE) - It extends Java SE with additional
        features useful for commercial apps.
    </li>
    <li>
        Java Micro Edition (ME) - This edition provides an optimized virtual
        machine that can be used to run Java apps on less powerful hardware such
        as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
    </li>
    <li>
        JavaFX - It creates rich internet apps that use hardware-accelerated
        graphics and media engines.
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Components of Java<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>There are three primary components of Java:<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong><br />One of the main
        features of Java is portability. The same code can run on different
        machines and operating systems. This is possible because of the Java
        Virtual Machine. Java code runs inside it and it's converted into native
        machine code that can run on the specific hardware it runs on.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</strong><br />JVM is a part of
        the Java Runtime Environment. JRE includes all the necessary libraries
        that are required to run the Java code. It communicates with the
        operating system to run the program.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong><br />JDK includes all of the
        above, and additional tools that help in developing Java applications.
