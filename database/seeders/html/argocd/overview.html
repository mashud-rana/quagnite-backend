    <strong>What Is ArgoCD<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    ArgoCD is a <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> (CD) and
    <strong>GitOps</strong> tool for Kubernetes.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Think about how apps are usually deployed into Kubernetes. Someone writes a
    YAML file, and then uses a 'kubectl apply' command to deploy stuff declared
    in that file. But this can quickly become a problem when multiple people are
    managing a Kubernetes cluster. It will be hard to track who created what,
    and what changes have happened lately. But a tool like ArgoCD makes this
    much more transparent and simple.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    People won't create YAML files on their laptops and then push changes to
    Kubernetes directly, making others wonder what might have changed last
    night. Instead, everyone will work through a
    <strong>Git repository</strong>. They'll all have a
    <em>common middleground</em>, instead of working on their own files, in
    isolation. And
    <strong
        >ArgoCD can continuously synchronize Kubernetes with the states that are
        defined in that repository</strong
    >. So it makes Kubernetes continuously
    <strong>follow the state declared in that Git repository</strong>. This is
    part of the reason why it's called a continuous delivery tool.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    It's worth noting that this depends on how ArgoCD is configured. It can be
    configured to require manual resynchronization when changes are pushed to
    Git, or it can be configured to do so automatically.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    For example, if John wants to create a cool deployment, he'll create a YAML
    file, and then upload it to this repository. ArgoCD will notice the new file
    and automatically deploy this to Kubernetes. Now Jane can take a look at the
    repository, and see exactly what John did. And if Jane has a nice idea about
    how to improve this deployment, she can suggest some edits to John's YAML
    file. John approves them, ArgoCD notices the changes again, and immediately
    resynchronizes Kubernetes with this new deployment definition.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    In a nutshell, the Git repository makes it very convenient for multiple
    people to collaborate on the changes they want to push to Kubernetes. And
    ArgoCD synchronizes Kubernetes with the states defined in this repository,
    at all times.<br /><br />

    <strong>ArgoCD Playground<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Setting up Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and a Git repository would take a very long
    time. So we saved you the trouble and prepared an environment where
    everything is provided.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    The playground is pre-configured with <strong>ArgoCD</strong> and
    <strong>Gitea</strong>. Gitea is a self-hosted Git service that is used to
    store files in a repository - an alternative to GitHub. For ease of use, we
    also provide
    <strong>web user interfaces for both Gitea and ArgoCD</strong>.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Start pushing changes to your Git repository and see ArgoCD in action! We
    hope you'll have a great time learning and experimenting in our
    playground.<br /><br />
