    <strong>What Is GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Nowadays, almost everything runs on the Internet. We have millions of apps,
    websites, and online services. And they all need computers to do their work.
    That's why billions of dollars are spent on
    <em>cloud computing</em> services. And Google Cloud Platform is just one of
    these cloud computing companies.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    But what can you do with GCP? Let's say you're a company that builds apps.
    How can cloud computing help you? Well, your apps will need to use things
    like:<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Databases</li>
    <li>Servers</li>
    <li>Storage space for files</li>
    <li>Containers running on Kubernetes clusters</li>
    <li>And so on</li>
</ul>
<div>
    Google Cloud lets you access such resources. You can pick between computing
    hardware or services. Here's an example of hardware vs. service. For
    example, you want a Kubernetes cluster. You have two options:<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        You rent a few virtual servers from Google Cloud. You pick how many CPU
        cores each server has. You choose the amount of RAM you need. And you
        also pick how many GB of storage space you want. Then you install
        Kubernetes software on all servers. Finally, you connect them with each
        other to form that cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's a long process to create a cluster manually. So you might want an
        easier way. On GCP you can buy Kubernetes as a service instead.
        Basically, you get access to a Kubernetes cluster, directly. You don't
        need to rent servers and configure them yourself. Google takes care of
        the server details, behind the scenes. You just buy the GKE service
        (Google Kubernetes Engine) and you get a ready-made cluster.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    like these. And this can be overwhelming for beginners. It's hard to
    understand what each product, or service does. It's hard to figure out how
    to configure each one. And that's why we created KodeKloud Playgrounds.<br /><br />

    You can read about Google Cloud on the Internet. You can check out
    tutorials. But with theory alone, it's still hard to understand GCP. So we
    created the Google Cloud Playground to let you get some hands-on experience.
    You will be able to use the cloud-compute platform directly. And you'll
    launch and configure services yourself. This will help you understand Google
    Cloud much faster. And you can test things, risk-free. No risk of receiving
    a huge bill for the services. No risk of breaking anything as it's just a
    temporary environment. You can reset and recreate it if you need to start
    over.<br /><br />

    Please read about each component you want to use. If you encounter any
    problems, the tips below may help (see stuff marked in
    <strong>bold text</strong>). Here's what we currently support in our GCP
    playground:<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Compute Engine<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>These are basically virtual machines, or virtual servers.<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Machine Configuration</strong>, for the CPU, use
        <strong>E2 </strong>or<strong> N1 Series</strong> with
        <strong>e2-medium</strong> type <strong>or smaller</strong> ,
        <strong>n1-standard-2 </strong>type or smaller.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the <strong>region</strong> you pick is:
        <strong>US Central</strong> or <strong>US West 1</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can use a maximum number of <strong>5vCPU cores</strong> for the
        entire project. For example, you could have two virtual machines with
        2vCPU cores each, and 1 machine with 1vCPU, for a total of 5.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>maximum disk/storage </strong>space<strong> is 50GB</strong>
        for the entire project (total of all machines). Use
        <strong>Standard Persistent Disk</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Kubernetes Engine (GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine)<br /></strong
    ><br />
</div>
<div>
    If you already have virtual machines running, first delete those. Otherwise
    you might not be able to launch this cluster. It would exceed the maximum
    number of 5 CPU cores you can use per project.<br /><br />
