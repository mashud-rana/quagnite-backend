    <strong>kubectl </strong>commands as you prepare for the certifications
    exam? Enhance your Kubernetes skills or practice what you’ve learned with
    this playground.

<div>
    A Kubernetes cluster is made out of multiple interconnected nodes (basically
    servers). This makes it easy to scale up when demand is high. We just add
    more nodes, and the cluster becomes more powerful and able to handle more
    traffic. When demand is lower, we scale down by removing nodes. This makes
    Kubernetes flexible, and easy to adjust. Furthermore, it also makes it more
    resilient. If one node experiences problems, another healthy one can quickly
    take its place. This makes the cluster <em>highly available</em>; it keeps
    working, even if some nodes malfunction.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    This playground will provide you with two nodes. One is the
    <strong>master node</strong>, and the other is the
    <strong>worker node</strong>. You will learn how to navigate between these
    two. You can SSH into any node you want and test your troubleshooting
    skills.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    If you want, you can also modify your master node to allow pods to be
    scheduled on it. This way, you can experiment with <em>pod scheduling</em>,
    <em>node affinity</em>, <em>taints</em>, <em>tolerations</em>, and so on.<br /><br />

    Please note that this playground is equipped with
    <strong>Flannel CNI</strong> which by default does not support NetworkPolicy
    resources. If you’re looking into practicing or want to dive into Network
    Policies, you can go to this playground instead, <br />

<div>
    <strong>What is Flannel CNI?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Container Network Interfaces or <strong>CNI </strong>enables networking
    capabilities within your Kubernetes cluster and internal components. It
    allows communication between nodes, pods, and also services. It is one of
    the primary components that is required in order to set up a Kubernetes
    cluster. One of the widely-used <strong>CNI </strong>available is
    <strong>Flannel</strong>. It is a lightweight and quite a basic network
    layer solely designed for Kubernetes. This is the CNI for those who want a
    simple and quick networking solution for their Kubernetes clusters and do
    not need any other advanced features like network policies to be
    implemented.<br /><br />
