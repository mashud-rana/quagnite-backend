    <strong>What is Python?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Python is the most versatile programming language to date. It covers the
    most use cases for modern technologies today such as scripting, web
    development, AI and machine learning, data analytics, QA automated testing,
    and more! That’s why it’s very important for DevOps engineers to learn
    Python since they will most likely work with these different types of
    technologies in the industry.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    DevOps practices, which deal with a lot of automation, often require you to
    write automation scripts. Python adds more power and features to your
    scripts that otherwise would be limited with just plain Bash scripts. Some
    of the tools that DevOps uses are usually written in Python, so having the
    knowledge will certainly become handy when troubleshooting tough issues.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Python also does exceptionally well with web development, as you can build
    complete frontend and backend web applications with the help of web
    frameworks such as Django and Flask. You can create your own consoles or
    custom dashboards to help you manage, monitor, and develop reporting
    mechanisms that make your life easier as a DevOps engineer.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Python is also great because it’s very easy to learn. If you’re new, no
    problem! The Python syntax is straightforward, clean, and super readable,
    making it easier to understand even with the most complex
    implementations.&nbsp;<br /><br />

    <strong>What’s new in Python version 3.8?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    1. <strong>New Walrus Operator</strong> - allows you to assign variables
    inside an expression<br /><br />
</div>
<blockquote>
    # Printing a variable involves assignment then a separate line to print<br />print_me
    = 'Hello World'<br />print(print_me)<br /><br /># Now, you can now do
    something like this. Cleaner and less code right?<br />print(print_me_too :=
    'Hello World')
</blockquote>
<div>Output:&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<blockquote>Hello World<br />Hello World</blockquote>
<div>
    2. <strong>F-Strings are now supported</strong> - F-strings allow you to
    print both variables and values for debugging purposes.<br /><br />
</div>
<blockquote>
    print_me = 'Hello World'<br />print(f'Hello, {print_me=}')
</blockquote>
<div>Output:<br /><br /></div>
<blockquote>Hello, print_me='Hello World'</blockquote>
<div>
    3.<strong> Positional-only parameters using “/” </strong>- In Python,
    functions support both positional and keyword parameters. The
    <strong>“/” </strong>gives you a clear identifier of the positional-only
    parameters.<br /><br />
</div>
<blockquote>
    # We put the slash in the 3rd parameter of the function<br /># This means a
    and b should only be positional parameters<br />def test (a, b, /, c, d):<br />&nbsp;
    &nbsp; print(a, b, c, d)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />test(1, 2, c=3, d=4)
</blockquote>
<div>Output:<br /><br /></div>
<blockquote>1 2 3 4</blockquote>
<div>
    If we set <strong>a </strong>and <strong>b </strong>as keyword parameters we
    get an error<br /><br />
</div>
<blockquote>
    def test (a, b, /, c, d):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; print(a, b, c, d)<br /><br />test(a='a',
    b='b', c=3, d=4)
</blockquote>
<div>Output:<br /><br /></div>
<blockquote>
    TypeError: test() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword<br />arguments:
    'a, b'
</blockquote>
