    <strong>What is GitLab?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    GitLab is a platform built for collaborative software development. You can
    create git repositories to store the files of your software projects. And it
    has plenty of tools to help with DevOps practices, such as building CI/CD
    pipelines to efficiently, and automatically build, test, and deliver
    software.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    There are two types of services offered by GitLab. One is from where you can
    just sign up for an account and use it from there. The other one is the
    self-managed GitLab server. With this second option, you simply set up
    GitLab on a server you manage on your own. This gives you more freedom since
    you can control every aspect of your configuration. Self-managed GitLab is
    usually the preference of many companies and businesses.<br /><br />

    <strong>GitLab Features<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>GIT Repository -</strong> GitLab has all the features you would
        expect from GIT. Safely store your project’s code base and enable
        versioning and tracking. Monitor merge request commits. Make it more
        secure by controlling user access to your repository.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Issues and Boards - </strong>GitLab has a boards and issues
        system allowing users to report bugs, track work on bug fixes, request
        features, monitor new feature implementations, and so on. In a nutshell,
        these allow people to collectively plan things, track how things are
        evolving, and implement changes in a transparent way, easy to follow for
        everyone involved.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>CI/CD - </strong>GitLab provides CI/CD pipelines built-in to
        your repositories. This allows you to configure your repositories to run
        automated pipelines as soon as there is a new commit to the branch.
        These pipelines can start by completely testing your application for
        each commit submitted. This can help catch some bugs and breaking
        changes much earlier in the development process. And lastly, you can
        utilize the CI/CD of GitLab to automatically perform deployments
        straight to your infrastructure, for any changes that passed the
        automated testing stages. Of course, it’s not limited to these types of
        pipelines only as they can be customized, depending on your needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Container Registry - </strong>GitLab also provides you with the
        functionality to store your OCI-compliant containers in your
        repositories. These container registries are useful if your software
        infrastructure uses or orchestrates any form of containerized
        applications built from Docker or anything similar. You can configure
        your CI/CD pipeline to push the packaged container images directly to
        these container registries. This provides quick, secure, and easy access
        to your private container images that can be pulled anytime. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User accounts with Access Control - </strong>GitLab also
        features user and access control over your repositories, so you can
        fine-tune permissions. Users can set up 2FA as additional security over
        their credentials. As an administrator, you can control who can access
        your project, and what each person should be allowed to do.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Many more features</strong> that help you manage software the DevOps
    way. For example, you also get access to
    <strong>monitoring and analytics</strong> tools that help you keep an eye on
    how your software projects are performing.<br /><br />
