    <strong>What is Kubernetes?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Kubernetes is initially hard to understand. Every website tells us it's a
    <em>container orchestrator</em>, but what does it actually do? Well, nothing
    makes things easier to understand than actually using this software
    yourself.
    <strong>Get access to a Kubernetes environment in seconds!</strong> No need
    to install anything. You just click a button and you get one ready-made,
    easily accessible from your browser. Enter
    <strong>kubectl</strong> commands, experiment, and see for yourself what
    this orchestrator is all about.<br /><br />

    Kubernetes makes it easy to run thousands of containers across hundreds of
    servers. It takes care of distributing every container where it should be.
    It makes sure failed containers are replaced automatically. It even ensures
    that the cluster nodes that fail also get replaced (if extra servers are
    already available). It auto-heals and keeps things running the way you
    instructed it to do. It's an automation tool that
    <em>orchestrates </em>stuff for you; makes sure things go according to plan.
    And since it mainly works with containers, these are some reasons why it's
    called a <em>container orchestrator</em>.<br /><br />

    <strong>What is Flannel CNI?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Container Network Interfaces or <strong>CNI </strong>enables networking
    capabilities within your Kubernetes cluster and internal components. It
    allows communication between nodes, pods, and also services. It is one of
    the primary components that is required in order to set up a Kubernetes
    cluster. One of the widely-used <strong>CNI </strong>available is
    <strong>Flannel</strong>. It is a lightweight and quite a basic network
    layer solely designed for Kubernetes. This is the CNI for those who want a
    simple and quick networking solution for their Kubernetes clusters and do
    not need any other advanced features like network policies to be
    implemented.<br /><br />
