    <strong>What are containers?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Containers are isolated environments for running applications. They hold the
    application code and all the required dependencies and configurations. Each
    container is logically isolated from the other containers, and the host
    system. When an app in one container misbehaves, the damage is usually
    limited to that container alone, and it does not spread to the other apps,
    or the host system.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    A container also helps with portability. That is, once you create a
    container, it should work pretty much the same way in any environment. For
    example, a container that works on Ubuntu 22.04 should also work on Ubuntu
    20.04, or an entirely different operating system, like Debian, Red Hat, or
    CentOS. This helps developers 'package once' and 'run anywhere'.<br /><br />

    <strong>Container Engines<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Container engines are tools that help users create container images, upload
    images to a central server, start and stop containers, manage networking
    between containers, and so on. These engines often come in layers, where
    higher-level tools delegate instructions to lower-level tools. For example,
    when Docker receives a command to start a container, it delegates this task
    to a component called runC. runC then takes care of creating and actually
    starting that container.<br /><br />

<div>
    <strong>Podman<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Podman is a daemonless container engine that provides users with a command
    line interface to work with containers. Podman provides commands that are
    very familiar to people who previously worked with Docker, as it uses the
    same syntax. Podman manages the entire container ecosystem including working
    with images, volumes, running or stopping containers, and even creating
    Pods. Pods are a way for grouping multiple containers into a single
    execution environment. You can think of it as a 'container for (multiple)
    containers'; helpful when you want these to run 'closer together' and share
    some resources more efficiently. For example, you could group an Nginx
    container with a MySQL container so that a web application can read from and
    write to the database more easily/faster.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Podman also provides a RESTFul API service for managing containers and
    provides a Podman client to interact with this service.<br /><br />

    <strong>Podman Playground<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    In this playground youâ€™re provided with Podman already installed on the
    CentOS 8 operating system so that you can begin practicing immediately. No
    additional setup or configuration is required, you only need a KodeKloud Pro
    subscription and then you can access a Podman-ready environment using your
    web browser.<br /><br />
