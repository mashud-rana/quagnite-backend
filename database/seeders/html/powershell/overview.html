<div><strong>What is PowerShell?<br></strong><br></div>
<div>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft. It consists of a command-line shell and an associated scripting language built on the .NET framework. Here are some key features and uses of PowerShell:<br><br></div>
<div><strong>Key Features of PowerShell<br></strong><br></div>
<div>
    <blockquote><strong>Command-Line Interface (CLI):</strong></blockquote>
    <p>PowerShell provides a command-line interface where users can run commands interactively.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Scripting Language:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>It is also a powerful scripting language that allows for the automation of administrative tasks and configuration management.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Cmdlets:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>PowerShell commands, known as cmdlets, follow a Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., Get-Process, Set-Location). Cmdlets perform specific operations and can be combined in scripts for more complex tasks.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Pipelining:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>PowerShell supports pipelining, allowing the output of one cmdlet to be passed as input to another cmdlet. This enables efficient data processing and task automation.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Unlike traditional text-based shells, PowerShell works with objects. This allows for more powerful manipulation of data, as cmdlets can pass .NET objects between each other.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Access to .NET Framework:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Since PowerShell is built on the .NET framework, it can leverage .NET classes and methods, enabling complex operations and integration with other .NET applications.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>PowerShell Core, the open-source version of PowerShell, is cross-platform and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
