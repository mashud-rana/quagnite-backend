    <strong>What Is AWS (Amazon Web Services)?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    AWS is currently the most popular platform for cloud computing services. But
    what is this 'cloud computing' thing? Well, think about an app that lets
    people shop online. How can it remember the shipping address of each user?
    It stores it in a database. And how can the user order a product? His app
    contacts some server. How is the user notified his order will arrive
    tomorrow? Through an email.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Database, server, email -- these are just a few examples of things the app
    needs to use. And AWS gives you access to such resources and services.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    So how can we sum up cloud computing? It's almost like you build your own
    datacenter in the cloud. You go to the AWS website and add anything that
    your app, service, or website needs. It's your custom-made datacenter, in
    the cloud. You don't care about the hardware that is required. You just buy
    and configure your cloud services. Amazon takes care of the hardware
    stuff.<br /><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>
    AWS has a you can buy. If you've never used a cloud computing platform
    before, this can be overwhelming. What do you start with? What is EC2? A
    virtual server? How do you configure it and connect to it? How do you create
    a Kubernetes cluster on AWS?<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    We know how hard it is to understand with theory alone. That's why we
    created the AWS Playground. With a simple click, you get quick access to the
    AWS platform. You can test things out and learn by doing. All of this
    without even having to create an account there. There's no risk of breaking
    anything. If you mess up, you can just launch a new playground.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Quick Start Guide<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    For a smooth experience, please read the guide below. Pay close attention to
    the stuff highlighted with <strong>bold text</strong>.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>The regions supported in our AWS playground are:<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>us-east-1</li>
    <li>us-east-2</li>
    <li>eu-central-1</li>
    <li>us-west-2</li>
    <li>eu-west-2</li>
    <li>ap-southeast-1</li>
</ul>
<div>
    And here are the AWS services you can currently test in our playground:<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>EC2 Instances (Virtual Machines / Servers)<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Elastic Compute instances, also called EC2, are basically virtual servers.
    They're called elastic because they are easy to scale up or down. For
    example, you can scale up from 4 CPU cores to 8 cores with a few mouse
    clicks. Or you can scale down from 8 CPU cores to 4, as easily. Same goes
    for RAM, or storage space.<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use a <strong>nano, micro</strong>, <strong>small</strong>, or
        <strong>medium</strong> size for the <strong>t1</strong>,
        <strong>t2</strong> and <strong>t3</strong> instances.
    </li>
    <li>
        For <strong>storage</strong> use the <strong>gp2</strong> (General
        Purpose) volume.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>maximum storage size</strong> we support is
        <strong>30GB</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    After you create your instance, you might not see it displayed. In that
    case, just press the <strong>refresh</strong> button in your web browser.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>S3 - Object Storage<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    An S3 bucket is a convenient place to store files. Apps or users can easily
    push files there (upload). And apps, or users can also easily pull them
    (download).<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Configuration is straightforward, but there is one tricky part. Make sure
    the <strong>bucket name is unique</strong>. It must be something that no one
    else on AWS uses. If it's hard to find a unique name, just add a random
    number in there, e.g., 'mybucket4884796837'.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>RDS - Relational Database Service<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    NoSQL is no good? Well, if you need a relational database instead, AWS has
    you covered. RDS supports the following database engines:<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>MariaDB</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Oracle</li>
    <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
    <li>Amazon Aurora</li>
</ul>
<div>
    The quickest way to get started is to pick the <strong>Free tier</strong> in
    the <strong>Templates </strong>section. This works with
    <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>MariaDB</strong>, and
    <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <div>‚Äç<br /><br /></div>
    <div>
        If you want to use a different engine, with custom settings, this will
        be trickier. You need to:<br /><br />
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick a <strong>Single DB Instance</strong>.</li>
        <li>
            Then choose a <strong>Burstable Class</strong> for the instance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, pick a <strong>micro</strong> or
            <strong>small</strong> instance.
        </li>
        <li>
            For <strong>storage</strong> select
            <strong>General Purpose SSD (gp2)</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <strong>EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service<br /></strong><br />
    </div>
    <div>
        If you want to create a Kubernetes cluster yourself, it can be a pretty
        long process. You need to launch a couple of Linux servers, then
        configure each one. And the configuration steps can be quite long. EKS
        lets you get such a cluster much faster, in mere minutes.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Cluster service role name = eksClusterRole</li>
        <li>CloudFormation stack name = eks-cluster-stack</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <strong>ECR - Elastic Container Registry<br /></strong><br />
    </div>
    <div>
        Here, you can create your own container repositories. Then you can
        upload/download container images just like you do on Docker Hub.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <div>
        If you want to test other AWS services, just type their name in the top
        search bar.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <div></div>

        <strong>other services that you can test in our playground</strong
