<div>Welcome to the Chef playground.<br /><br /></div>
<div>
    Our playground comes equipped with everything you need to experiment with
    Chef, risk-free! Everything is available in your web browser. No need to
    install complicated software or rent servers.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Chef is a company with several software automation products. This playground
    focuses on Chef Infra, a configuration management automation
    software.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    In simple terms,
    <strong
        >Chef Infra automates the configuration &amp; management of
        servers.</strong
    >
    That includes things such as managing users &amp; permissions, installing
    &amp; configuring software, and other similar tasks.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    First, let's talk about some important terms used in the Chef universe.<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Resources:</strong> Resources are used to configure
        infrastructure, such as creating users, installing packages, etc. A
        resource declares the steps needed to bring a resource type (such as
        user, file &amp; package) to the desired state. It is written using the
        Ruby programming language.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recipes:</strong> Multiple resources are grouped together to
        form a recipe. Recipes tell Chef which resources you want to configure
        on your server.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cookbooks:</strong> Multiple recipes together form a cookbook.
        Cookbooks are designed to perform a specific set of tasks. For example,
        the mysql cookbook is used to manage MySQL databases.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Chef Infra Components<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Chef Infra’s architecture is divided into three main components:<br /><br />
</div>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Chef Workstation:</strong> The Chef workstation is a location
        where you can write &amp; test cookbooks. You can also interact with the
        Chef Infra Server using “knife”. Knife is Chef’s command line tool. It
        is used to upload cookbooks to Chef Infra Server. The Chef Workstation
        package includes the Chef Infra Client.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Chef Infra Client:</strong> The Chef Infra Client is installed
        on each node (a physical or virtual machine) managed by Chef Infra. When
        the Chef Infra Client is run on a node, it retrieves cookbooks from the
        Chef Server and executes them. This brings the node into the expected
        state.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Chef Server:</strong> The Chef Server is a central hub for
        configuration information. It stores cookbooks, the policies that are
        applied to the systems in your infrastructure, and metadata that
        describe each system.
    </li>
</ol>
<div>
    <strong>Playground Features<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    The playground includes a standalone server that runs both a
    <strong>Chef Workstation</strong> &amp; a
    <strong>Chef Infra Server</strong>. It also includes a repository called
    <strong>chef-repo</strong>. Chef-repo is a collection of files and
    directories containing cookbooks and configuration policies needed to manage
    your infrastructure.<br /><br />
