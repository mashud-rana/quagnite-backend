    To understand Helm, think about a program installed on a Windows computer.
    This program has hundreds or thousands of files. But when you install it,
    you just use one file, maybe setup.exe. When you uninstall it, you just use
    Add/Remove Programs from Control Panel. You don't need to go around
    installing each file, or removing each file. The setup application
    <strong>tracks all files that belong to that application</strong>. Helm does
    a similar thing for Kubernetes applications.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    For example, you might have a WordPress installation running on Kubernetes.
    This will need Pods, Services, Deployments, Secrets, and who knows what
    other objects. Normally, you'd need to have multiple YAML files where you
    define your Services, Deployments, Secrets, and so on. Imagine you need 20
    different WordPress websites in your cluster. It will become hard to install
    them all. You'd need to 'kubectl apply -f' hundreds of YAML files,
    potentially. And then track what YAML file belongs to what website. Helm
    simplifies that by <strong>grouping YAML files together</strong> and
    <strong>tracking what objects belong to what application</strong>. It's like
    a setup.exe for your Kubernetes applications. With one command, it installs
    all objects required. With another command, it can uninstall all objects
    required by a particular application. And more interestingly, it can also
    upgrade or downgrade them.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Helm groups all the objects required by some application, in what it calls a
    <strong>Helm Chart</strong>. This is simply a directory (or archive) that
    contains a bunch of files that describe that application to Kubernetes.<br /><br />

    course is the perfect way to get started with Helm. You will go through the
    basic concepts of Helm and understand its architecture. Learn how to create
    Helm charts and use different functions and conditionals.<br /><br />

    <strong>Features of Helm<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ease the deployment and management of applications on the Kubernetes
        cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        Easily download and install Helm charts developed by others. It's
        similar to how you can use Docker containers from the Internet.
    </li>
    <li>Ability to upgrade the application or roll back the changes.</li>
    <li>Customize the configuration of the applications during deployment.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Components of Helm<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>1. Helm Client<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>Command line interface for the end users.</li>
    <li>Used to download, install, or uninstall charts, plus other actions.</li>
    <li>
        Used to upgrade applications to their next version, or downgrade to the
        previous version in case something goes wrong.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>2. Helm library<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Contains the logic for implementing the operations sent by the Helm
        client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interacts with the Kubernetes API server to perform all the operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsible for managing the life cycle of the applications managed
        through these charts.
    </li>
</ul>
