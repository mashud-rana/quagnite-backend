    Want to learn how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools? Curious about
    how Terraform works?<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    With our playground, you can start experimenting with automated
    infrastructure provisioning in minutes. No need to go through any
    installations - everything is accessible from within your browser. The
    playground comes pre-installed with Terraform and is configured to use AWS
    to deploy your infrastructure. You don't even need an AWS account.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>What is Terraform?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Terraform is one of the most popular Infrastructure as Code tools. It helps
    you create and manage your infrastructure, like servers and databases, in a
    more automated and efficient way.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Instead of manually setting up your infrastructure, you can use Terraform to
    describe your infrastructure in the form of configuration files. These files
    are similar to a blueprint of your infrastructure and can be used to
    provision new infrastructure or update existing infrastructure.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Terraform Workflow&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    To provision infrastructure in Terraform, you follow three main steps:
    write, plan &amp; apply.<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Writing:</strong> In the writing stage, you define the
        infrastructure you want in a Terraform configuration file, written using
        HashiCorp Corporation Language (HCL).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Planning:</strong> After writing your Terraform configuration,
        you use the 'terraform plan<em>'</em> command to preview the changes
        that will be made to your infrastructure. You use this step to verify
        that the changes are correct before applying them.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Applying:</strong> The final step in the process is to use the
        'terraform apply<em>'</em> command to apply the changes defined in the
        execution plan. This will create/change the infrastructure to match the
        desired state defined in the configuration files.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Terraform &amp; Cloud Infrastructure Providers<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Terraform interacts with resources on cloud infrastructure platforms (such
    as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) using Providers.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Terraform Providers are plugins that handle all the logic of authenticating,
    making API requests, and dealing with timeouts and errors. Providers are
    written using the Go language and distributed as binaries on the Terraform
    registry.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    The Terraform core (the engine that powers Terraform) communicates with the
    plugins via <em>remote procedure calls </em>(RPCs), and the plugins
    communicate with their corresponding cloud platforms via the network (via
    HTTP calls for example).<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Playground Features<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Our playground comes with a command line where you can enter Terraform
    commands to interact with the sandbox AWS account.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Playground Notes<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Note that you can use the playground for 1 hour. If required, you can extend
    the usage by 15 minutes by clicking on the icon next to the timer
    icon.&nbsp;<br /><br />
