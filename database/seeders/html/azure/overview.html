    <strong>What Is Microsoft Azure<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Imagine you need to build a Kubernetes cluster in the real world. You need
    to buy a few servers, configure them, run network cables to each one. Then
    you need to install and configure Kubernetes-related software on each one.
    It's a complicated process.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Cloud computing lets you do this stuff much faster. For example, let's say
    you want that Kubernetes cluster. But you want to do this in the cloud,
    instead of buying your own hardware. With a few clicks on a web page, you
    select the AKS, Azure Kubernetes Service. Then you pick how many nodes you
    want in that cluster, how many resources each node should have, and bam! You
    have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster. No need to even configure a
    server.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>Here are some other examples of Azure services:<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>
        In case you need a server where you want to install an operating system,
        you can use a virtual machine. Then you can configure it as you would a
        real server. You pick how many CPU cores you want, how much memory, how
        much disk space, and so on. You basically build a virtual computer in
        the cloud. But if you don't want to manage a server on your own, then
        you have other alternatives. For example, you can:
    </li>
    <li>
        Store and use databases without needing to configure a server yourself
    </li>
    <li>Run code in the cloud, again with no need to configure a server</li>
    <li>
        Run containers (for example, Docker containers). Yet again, no need to
        configure servers.
    </li>
    <li>Get storage space where you can backup data or simply store files.</li>
    <li>And so on. The available in the cloud is huge.</li>
</ul>

    <strong>KodeKloud Azure Playground<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    It's nice that you can choose from hundreds of things. If you want to build
    any type of service, the cloud has you covered. It gives you access to
    almost anything you might require. But this immense selection of services
    can also intimidate. Especially at first sight. It's hard to figure out what
    those things do and how you should use them. And it takes a bit of
    experimenting to understand them. That's why we created playgrounds at
    KodeKloud.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    The Azure Playground lets you test out a few of these cloud-hosted services.
    So you can see for yourself what's what. With a simple click, you can
    <strong>immediately begin testing the Azure platform</strong>. No need to
    create an Azure account, provide credit/debit card details, and so on. One
    click and you get dropped into the Azure web interface. So you get to play
    with Azure services, risk free. There's no risk of forgetting to close a
    service and wake up with a $200 bill.<br /><br />

    <strong>Quick Start Guide<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    To avoid any issues, please read the guide below. The text highlighted with
    <strong>bold</strong> is important.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Here are the services available at this time in our playground:<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>Virtual Machines<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Virtual machines are basically servers that you run in the cloud. You can
    choose what operating system you want, and then configure the resources each
    server should have.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>When you launch these, make sure to choose:<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>
        A disk that is a <strong>standard SSD</strong> or an
        <strong>HDD </strong>(locally-redundant storage).
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>maximum disk size</strong> we currently support in the
        playground is <strong>128GB</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Virtual Machine Scale Sets<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    The VM Scale Set is a collection of virtual servers. As they are used more
    intensely, more will auto-launch, to keep up with demand. If there's less
    pressure on them, the extra ones will automatically disappear as they are
    not needed anymore.<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scaleset Maximum Count: 3.</strong></li>
    <li>
        The <strong>name of the scaleset</strong> must be
        <strong>app-scaleset</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scaling Policy Type</strong> should be <strong>Manual</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>Azure SQL<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    This gives you full access to an SQL database. And it does not require you
    to manage a server where the database would be hosted.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Our Azure playground currently supports databases that use:<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>A maximum of <strong>2 vCPU cores</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>50GB of data</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        In the <strong>Backup storage redundancy</strong> section select
        <strong>Locally-redundant backup storage</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>AKS - Azure Kubernetes Service<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    You can create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure with these properties:<br /><br />
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum <strong>node size of B2s</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>2 nodes pool size</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Container insights</strong> and <strong>alerting</strong> should
        be <strong>disabled</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
