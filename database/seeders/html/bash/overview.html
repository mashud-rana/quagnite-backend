<div><strong>What is PowerShell?<br></strong><br></div>
<div>Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a Unix shell and command language, widely used as the default shell on Linux and macOS. It is a powerful tool for system administration, scripting, and automation.<br><br></div>
<div><strong>Key Features of Bash<br></strong><br></div>
<div>
    <blockquote><strong>Command-Line Interface (CLI):</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Bash provides a text-based interface where users can type commands to interact with the operating system.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Scripting Language:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Bash supports writing scripts, which are collections of commands saved in a file. These scripts can automate repetitive tasks.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Compatibility:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Bash is backward-compatible with the Bourne shell (sh), and many commands are also compatible with other Unix shells.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Pipelines:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Bash supports piping, where the output of one command can be passed as input to another command using the pipe (|) operator.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Variables:</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Bash supports variables, which can store data such as strings and numbers, and can be used in scripts to create dynamic content.</p>
