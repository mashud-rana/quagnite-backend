    <strong>What is Ansible?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    It's easy to create, manage, and configure one or two servers manually. But
    when you have hundreds or thousands, it becomes impossible. So we need tools
    that can do that automatically.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Ansible is both a Configuration Management and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
    tool. It helps administrators provision, and configure, hundreds, or
    thousands of infrastructure components easily. All by just providing
    instructions in some files (called Playbooks), that Ansible can understand
    and then execute on thousands of components, all at once. These automation
    tasks can be as simple as upgrading software on a server. But they can also
    be more complex, like deploying multiple applications, configuring them, and
    then interconnecting all of them to enable a web application.<br /><br />
