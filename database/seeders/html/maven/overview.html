    <strong>What Is Maven?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Maven is a software project management tool. It can manage a project’s
    build, reporting, and documentation, in a simplified way using a central
    piece of information. Maven provides a standard way to manage projects that
    makes it easy for developers to understand project structure and build
    lifecycle. Although it can build software written in multiple languages, it
    is mostly used for Java projects.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>Maven can provide the following features:<br /><br /></div>
<ul>
    <li>Build lifecycle</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Reporting</li>
    <li>Dependency management</li>
    <li>Release and distribution</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <strong>How Maven Works<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    The main tasks that Maven is responsible for are software build lifecycle
    and dependency management.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    To declare how these tasks should work, Maven uses what is called a POM
    file. POM is an XML file that contains the project information and defines
    its build configuration.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    The build lifecycle defines the steps required to run on the project to
    generate a final artifact for the software. These steps can include
    compilation, unit testing, and packaging the compiled code into a
    distributable format. In order for Maven to execute these steps it uses some
    type of <strong>plugin</strong> for each specific step. And using this
    plugin it runs what is called a <strong>goal</strong>. This goal defines the
    step that Maven wants the plugin to do.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    For example, Maven uses a “maven-compiler-plugin” to execute the “compile”
    goal. By using this goal the source code is compiled as part of the project
    lifecycle.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    To make it easier to manage projects, each set of goals are combined into
    what is called a lifecycle <strong>phase</strong>. These phases should be
    well defined inside the lifecycle and used as a standard method for building
    projects. When any phase is executed this means that all goals included in
    this phase are executed. You can still run individual goals outside of
    phases when needed.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Maven also makes dependency management easier in large projects. When
    writing software code, you don’t want to implement some functionality from
    scratch that might have been implemented before and can be reused directly
    in your project. When this functionality is a common part that might be
    reused multiple times in different projects, it is usually packaged in its
    own separate piece of code, and can be imported inside your application.
    This piece of code is what we call a <strong>dependency</strong>. When you
    write code, you'll usually want to use such dependencies, to avoid rewriting
    what is already available online. Managing these dependencies, how to
    download them, how to add them to your application, and which version you
    require, is called dependency management.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Maven uses repositories to store dependencies in a centralized location. You
    can then use these repositories to download any specific dependencies you
    need when you build your application through Maven commands. You declare the
    dependencies you require, the plugins and goals to be executed, and other
    project configuration, in the POM file (this is a centralized location from
    where Maven can read project information and configuration). When you run a
    Maven command that triggers the build of the application, then Maven will
    look for the POM file, read the configuration, and start downloading the
    dependencies and executing the required tasks.<br /><br />
