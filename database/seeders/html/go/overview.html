    <strong>What is GoLang?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    <strong>GoLang </strong>or <strong>Go </strong>is an open-source programming
    language supported by <strong>Google</strong>. Its syntax and code structure
    are very easy to learn and get started with. While other programming
    languages achieve parallelism and concurrency through the use of third-party
    libraries, Go has this feature built-in natively. It's lightweight and
    feature-rich; ideal for applications that handle large traffic or heavy
    computing without consuming too many resources.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Go is considered one of the top languages used in
    <strong>DevOps</strong>,<strong> </strong>right next to
    <strong>Python</strong>,<strong> </strong>as many tools that empower DevOps
    practices such as CI/CD and Infrastructure-as-Code are written in these
    languages.<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    This makes it one of the top skills to learn for open-source and DevOps
    professionals.<br /><br />

    <strong>What can you build with Go?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    You can build many things with Go, from web applications, to cloud platform
    integration tools. You can also build software that helps provision and
    automate infrastructure, for DevOps, or Site Reliability purposes.<br /><br />

<div>
    <strong>What does the syntax look like?<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    Here’s a simple snippet that prints the text “Hello World”. Notice how the
    composition of the code is similar to other languages such as C++ and Java.
    This makes Go easy to learn.<br /><br />
</div>
<blockquote>
    package main<br />import ('fmt')<br /><br />func main() {<br />&nbsp;
    fmt.Println('Hello World!')<br />}

    <strong>Playground Features<br /></strong><br />
</div>
<div>
    In this playground, you’ll gain <strong>60 </strong>minutes of access to an
    <strong>Ubuntu operating system</strong> environment pre-installed and fully
    equipped with <strong>Go and Visual Studio Code IDE </strong>straight to
    your browser.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    Multi-task by opening multiple tabs to the same environment and have the
    ability to run <strong>Go </strong>code from multiple files. Practice and
    hone your skills with Go, write well-written code or test functionalities,
    or even take the concurrency feature to the test and discover more features
    <strong>Go </strong>can offer.&nbsp;<br /><br />
</div>
<div>
    If you need more time, this sandbox environment also allows you to extend
    the time by <strong>15-minute increments</strong>, giving you more time for
    practice.<br /><br />
